# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* What is a popular web framework on github?
* Language with the greatest repository count.
* Repos with the most forks?
* Repos with the most stars (favorites)? 
* Most cloned repos? 
* Most watched repos?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.

My teams question is:
What web framework repository on GitHub has the greatest number of stars?
